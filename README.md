# CS120B Custom Project (Dodge!) Winter 2020

Dodge! is a simple platform game in which the player controls a character on the LCD screen with a joystick. The character must dodge obstacles in order to survive. If the character collides with an obstacle, then they die and are able to see their score. It is important to note that the character and obstacles are depicted as unique, custom characters.
The player starts the game by pushing the joystick. At any point, the player can press the button to reset the game, which also resets their current score. 
There are also two speakers used for this game. One plays the background music and the other makes a sound whenever the player's character moves. Neither speaker cancels the other out.
